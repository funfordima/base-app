For sure Scrum is flexible framework and welcoming change.
Flexibility lies in the ability to react on change/feedback and implement during the next Sprint period. 

Change can be related to scope, schedule, cost, quality. Examples:
- Scope: Added something new in functionality, changed behaviour, removed something
- Schedule: Somebody got sick, estimate is changed after detailed view, blocked
- Cost: need to implement faster solution for problem, etc.


Since we are trying to be effective and implement what we planned in the Sprints we need to have the process which saves us from braking the initial plans.


Process is to be described in details later for now we can accept change if any of condition below is satisfied:
- if it's directly related to the Goal of the Sprint and manageable to complete with planned capacity buffer
- if it's related to the scope which was not done yet and change doesn't introduce more efforts
- if we can move something out from the Sprint to balance remaining capacity accordingly


In case of doubts and risk to impact plans of the Sprint (Sprint Goals, items count:User story, Bug), please,  contact Scrum Master to help with judging if we need to accept change or move to the future.
