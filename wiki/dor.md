[Copy paste from other projects - to be aligned with team, and confirmed - "Following" the article is equal to confirmation.

A sprint is a time-boxed development cycle that includes high-priority items from the backlog which should be in the top focus of the team during Sprint duration. And it is usually expected that Sprint produces Product increment.

In order to plan our Sprint effectively, we need to estimate efforts effectively before Sprint start. In order to estimate we need potential Sprint items to be well described beforehand.

A “ready” backlog item needs to be clear, feasible, and testable*:


1. A user story has a positive case scenario described 
1. A user story has feasible and testable acceptance criteria
1. A user story is small enough to be completed within one sprint (Not always, to improve in future)
1. A user story brings complete business value, except for spikes (if it is too big we need to split it, in this case we can sacrifice the value)
1. A user story contains identified dependencies 
1. All required attributes are provided to the user story if needed (design, environments, 3rd party access, etc.)
1. The team has a clear understanding of the user story and doesn't have open questions
1. A user story is prioritized 
1. A user story is negotiated, decomposed and estimated by the team


*Exception: In case User story contains Tag [No QA] in the title, testing can be sacrificed for such story (probably it is a long playing story and would be tested far in the future).

Some questions to ask on Refinements (questions formed due to our experience after releases):
 
- Impact of story on current state (Should something be modified for all car list? Example: Extended Warranty should be applied for all car list but not only newly created?)
- Should we have GA tracking for the story?
- Should we be able to switch functionality off/on in the near future?
- Should it be possible to edit content and apply changes asap?
-
