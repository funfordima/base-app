Estimation allows us to understand the cost of the issue, to understand if the scope is clear or there are some uncertainties.

We have several level of estimation: High-level, Story level, Task level.

Ideally, before High-Level estimate big initiatives should have Pre-screening where High level architecture is defined.

---
**High-level estimate** is used on the level if Quarter forecasts, it's used to roughly understand the size of the Epic/Feature/Story. PO later uses these estimates to define priority of the certain initiative and understand if it fits to the quarter.

T-Shirt Size â€“ [XS | S | M | L | XL]  
XS - half of the Sprint 
S - from 1 to 2 Sprint 
M - from 2 to 3 Sprints
L - from 3 to 5 Sprints 
XL - more than 5 Sprints

**Story level estimate:**
We create task in each Story for each stack to understand involvement and set "Draft" in Summary as a subject for following reestimate when get more details about the issue. Example of tasks estimates: (Estimates there are rounded to 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 ? - assumption, will be clarified later today and corrected Sep 21, 2022)
- [BE] Draft Estimate
- [FE] Draft Estimate 
- [QA] Draft Estimate 
- [AQA] Draft Estimate

**Task level estimate:**

Used on Sprint preplanning, to more precisely understand involvement of each stack and plan Sprint efficiently.

Ideal hours are used in this estimate.
1 day = 5 ideal hours

Limitations: Task shouldn't exceed 15 hours, otherwise should be sliced.

If there is no confidence in estimate, then "?" should be set in the title to bring attention and elaborate on estimate separatelly.
